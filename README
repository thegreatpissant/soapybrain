The SoapyBrain engine, my personal experiment.

Originally my opengl experiments.  It is now a work on its own.

* Requires
  - glew
  - glm
  - freeglut
  - video card supporting at least opengl 2.0
* Building
  All current work is happening in the opengl-programming-guide directory
  > cd opengl-programming-guide
  > mkdir build
  > cd build
  > cmake ../
  > make 
  Then run the programs
