The SoapyBrain engine, my personal experiment.

Originally my opengl experiments.  It is now a work on its own.

* Requires
  - glew
  - glm
  - freeglut
  - video card supporting at least opengl 2.0
* Building
  You may use the BuildProject.sh script or do the following
  > mkdir build
  > cd build
  > ln -s ../shaders ./  # this is for the examples to work correctly
  > cmake-gui ../
  > make 
  if you enabled the examples they are in the ./build/soapybrain-examples dir.
